# Executive Summary — Retail KPI Dashboard

## Objective
Create a clean, executive-friendly Power BI dashboard that surfaces key performance metrics and enables rapid drill-in without clutter.

## Audience
Recruiters / hiring managers assessing practical BI skills (Power BI, DAX, layout, interactivity).

## Dashboard Overview
**Page: Main Dashboard**
- KPI cards: Total Sales, Total Profit, Profit Margin %, Total Units, Avg Sale Price
- Trend: Sales over time
- Breakdown: Top Products by Sales (Top-N)
- Filters (slicers): Year, Segment, Country
- UX: Hover tooltips provide deeper product context without adding extra visuals

**Page: Tooltip – Product**
- Mini KPI summary
- Tiny trend chart
- Small breakdown chart (e.g., by Country)

## Key Techniques Demonstrated
- Data modeling with a semantic model
- DAX measures for KPIs
- Top-N filtering to focus attention on key contributors
- Report-page tooltips for drill-in context
- Clean layout / minimal clutter principles

## Notes
This project uses Microsoft's sample Financial dataset to keep the emphasis on BI execution (modeling + measures + visualization best practices).
